* Sprint 1: Back-End Build Out
    * Back-End Test
    * Use Postman to test all CRUD

* Sprint 2: Front-End Boiler Plate
    * Skeleton- forms, cards
    * JWT Auth
    * Sign In/Out
    * Logic/Funcionality
    * Test Front-End, Back-End connection
    * Axios GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

* Sprint 3: Stripe API
    * Stripe Tutorial
    * Stripe Integration into project
    * Stripe Testing

* Sprint 4 Multer
    * Multer Tutorial
    * Multer Integration
    * Create new API avatar endpoint

* Sprint 5: Heroku
